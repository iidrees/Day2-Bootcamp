The tasks for today is to solve two andelab tests, 
The first Andelabs called countWords requires you to create a function that takes an array and then returns the words in the string and the number of times the words were repeated, to be stored in JSON format. 
The second Andelabs is called reverseString which requires you to create a function that takes a string and then reverses the string. If the string will still be the same after being reversed then the function should return 'true'.
Both functions have tests suites provided for them.

The last task is to write an simple http client program that consumes a public API

I was supposed to write test for the getPrimes and OOP programs, but I could only write for the getPrimes program.
